### Project Description
ChatterWaste is a delightfully chaotic web app that combines the bare minimum of a productivity tool with the maximum sass of a roast bot. Think of it as your personal anti-life coach ‚Äî one that encourages procrastination, mocks your goals, and turns every attempt at productivity into a full-blown comedy roast. Want to add a task? Too bad. The planner will hit you with a cheeky one-liner that makes you second-guess trying in the first place. Need advice or motivation? The roast bot has your back ‚Äî by stabbing it with sarcasm, existential dread, and Gen-Z humor.Designed with soothing pastel colors, quirky fonts, and a deceptively "productive" layout, ChatterWaste lures you in with calm vibes ‚Äî only to sabotage your plans with roasts, distractions, and chaos. Whether you're a chronic overthinker, a professional procrastinator, or just someone who enjoys a good roast while failing to complete your to-do list, ChatterWaste turns doing nothing into an art form.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Traditional productivity apps focus on discipline, goals, and efficiency ‚Äî but they often ignore the reality of procrastination, guilt, and burnout. For many users, especially students, this creates pressure rather than motivation. There‚Äôs a lack of tools that meet people where they are: distracted, tired, and in need of a laugh.ChatterWaste addresses this gap by combining a procrastination planner with a witty roast bot that embraces unproductivity with humor and sass. Instead of pushing users to do more, it helps them feel seen, roasted, and oddly comforted ‚Äî all while doing absolutely nothing.



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
To solve the 'deep-rooted' problem of being overwhelmed by productivity apps, we proudly present: ChatterWaste ‚Äî a platform that does absolutely nothing helpful. Instead of organizing your tasks, it roasts your ambitions. Instead of keeping you on track, it encourages derailment with sass, sarcasm, and beautifully unmotivating one-liners.Our solution? Give users a procrastination planner that actively sabotages their planning attempts and a roast bot that offers emotional damage instead of guidance ‚Äî all wrapped in soothing pastel colors to confuse the brain into thinking everything's fine. It's not efficient, it‚Äôs not productive, but it sure is a vibe.
